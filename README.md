Here, in this game we have to shoot some dangerous fishes and that will help us to gain some score, if we scored some point in limited time then we will be declared as a winner otherwise loser.

Here in this game enemy fishes are of diffrent kind, like some die earlier than other other(also they gives point accordingly).

One fish named lucky fish, is actually lucky for us because it need less ammo to kill but provide us more point or scores and if it touches our main player(the one we are handling) then it power ups our main player and it makes our ammo full and release two ammo at once till 10 secs.

one fish named hive fish is needs many ammos to be killed, and after that it release mant small drone fishes.

one more thing, we need to consider is that, we also get negative score if any of enemy fish touches our main player.
