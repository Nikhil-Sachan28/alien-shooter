Here in this game enemy fishes are of diffrent kind, like some die earlier than other other(also they gives point accordingly).

one fish named lucky fish, is actually lucky for us because it need less ammo to kill but provide us more point and if it touches our main player(the one we are handling) then it power ups our main player and it makes our ammo full and release two ammo at once till 10 secs.
